# Customer Lifetime Value analysis and prediction

IBM is a leading high-tech company specialized in providing cognitive solutions and insurance claim processes to B2B customers. The company introduced **IBM Watson**, an advanced AI assistant catering to car insurance claimants.

Facing a decline in overall market performance, including revenue and net income, IBM identified the customer lifetime value (CLV) as a pivotal metric for strategic enhancement. CLV measures the total expected income from a typical customer throughout their relationship with the business. Besides, we identified two major problems of IBM's operational status. 

1.Firstly, the CLV concentrates on a low level, with very few of them scatter in high-CLV intervals. 

2. Secondly, the compensation ratio shows an ascending trend, imposing damages to profits.
IBM's current customer management strategy involves analyzing target customers, allocating resources accordingly, and nurturing selected customers to boost future profitability.
